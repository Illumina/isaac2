/** 
 ** \brief global optimization for alignments with a maximum gap size
 ** 
 ** Assumes that the scores fit into a short integer (2 bytes).
 ** Requires SSE4 for "v8hi __builtin_ia32_pmaxsw128 (v8hi, v8hi)".
 ** _mm_max_pi16 is probably an mmx instruction
 ** 
 ** This implementation is limited to a maximum gap width of 15 bases
 ** (+/-7 bands) so that all operations can be done over two registers.
 **
 ** The registers are aligned to the database.
 **
 ** Note: this is non-copyable because of the dynamically-allocated internal
 ** buffer.
